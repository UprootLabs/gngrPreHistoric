This is a fork of CssParser, originally maintained
at http://cssparser.sourceforge.net. A list of our
modifications follow:

- Changed to allow classes with underscore and
  those that start with a number.
  
- Changed to use the local parser always, as 
  there were class loader issues.

- Error logging was tweaked.

- (11/25/2007) Order of lookup of property values
  in style declarations was changed.
  
- (01/19/2008) Fixed StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  in SACParserTokenManager.trimUrl.
  
- (02/02/2008) Optimized CSSStyleDeclarationImpl.

- (02/23/2008) Fixed so that background properties
  with a color value followed by a URI don't lose
  the URI.
  
- (02/23/2008) Added support for alpha(opacity=XX).

- (02/23/2008) Now allowing CSS properties that
  start with an underscore. SourceForge had one.
  
- (08/23/2008) Fixed so that erroneous tokens in
  style rule declarations cause the declaration to
  be skipped, instead of the entire block.
  
- (08/30/2008) Added try-catch for hex color number
  format exceptions. 
  
- (01/18/2009) Worked around NPE with rect().

- (01/24/2009) Fixed stack overflow error on
  some invalid rule declarations, previoulsy 
  introduced.
